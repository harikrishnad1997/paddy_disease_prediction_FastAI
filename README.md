# Plant Pathology Challenge - Predection of labels of diseases from images using ensembling and FastAI

<h1>Description</h1>

This project explores the use of deep learning for plant disease detection, participating in the Plant Pathology Challenge:

<h1>Objective</h1>

To develop a model that accurately classifies different plant diseases in images, contributing to improved agricultural outcomes by:

* Early and accurate disease detection for better crop health and yield.
* Enhanced decision-making through informed choices regarding treatment and resource allocation.
* Promotion of sustainable agriculture by minimizing reliance on chemicals

<h1>Data Source</h1>

* Training set: Images of diverse plant diseases, pre-processed to a maximum dimension of 600 pixels
* Publicly available dataset derived from the Plant Pathology 2021 - FGVC8 Kaggle competition [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/inclassplantpathologysmallf23]()

<h1>Final results</h1>

Score: 0.86256
